## About The Data Set
The data set contains various features of different cars and thier carbon emission

### Keys

Model	
- 4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive
- AWD = All-wheel drive
- FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle
- SWB = Short wheelbase
- LWB = Long wheelbase
- EWB = Extended wheelbase

Transmission	
- A = automatic
- AM = automated manual
- AS = automatic with select shift
- AV = continuously variable
- M = manual
- 3 - 10 = Number of gears

Fuel type	
- X = regular gasoline
- Z = premium gasoline
- D = diesel
- E = ethanol (E85)
- N = natural gas

- Fuel consumption	
City and highway fuel consumption ratings are shown in litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km) - the combined rating (55% city, 45% hwy) is shown in L/100 km and in miles per imperial gallon (mpg)

- CO2 emissions	the tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide (in grams per kilometre) for combined city and highway driving

## Functionality Of The AI

The AI has three main functionalities
- Feature Selection
- Predicting Emission Of Cars
- Suggest Alternative Cars

### Feature Selection
This has to do with determining which features of the car actually contribute towards carbon emission

### Predicting Emission Of Cars
After the important features are selected, different ML algorithms are used to create models that predict the carbon emission of various cars

### Suggest Alternative 
The model created is then used to predict the carbon emission of cars based on the inputed specifications and then suggests similar cars that generates less carbon
